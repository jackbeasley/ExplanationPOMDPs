  abstract = {Human experts in many scientific fields routinely work with data that are heterogeneous, noisy, and/or uncertain, as well as with heuristics that are unproven and with possible conclusions that are contradictory. We present a deployed software system for cosmogenic isotope dating, a domain that is fraught with these difficult issues. This system, which is called ACE (Age Calculation En-gine), takes as inputs the nuclide densities in a set of rock samples from a landform. It answers the scientific question, ``What geological processes could have produced this distribution of nuclide concentrations, and over what time scales? '' ACE employs an encoded knowledge base of the pos-sible processes that may have acted on that landform in the past, complete with the mathematics of how those processes can affect samples, and it uses a workflow system to encode the computations associated with this scientific analysis. Flexibility and extensibility were critical issues in ACE's design to allow its scientist-users to modify and extend it after its developers were no longer in-volved. The success of this is evident; the system remains in active use to this day, several years after the development cycle ended, without a single request for help from the geoscientists to the computer science side of the team. The ACE project website has received over 17,000 hits since 2008, including 2500 over the last twelve months. The software ({$\sim$}20,000 lines of Python code) has been downloaded nearly 600 times as of April 2013, which is a significant number in a research community of a few hundred PI-level scientists. 1.},

In this paper we offer an analysis of the nature of scientific understanding that accords with actual scientific practice and accommodates the historical diversity of conceptions of understanding. Its core idea is a general criterion for the intelligibility of scientific theories that is essentially contextual: which theories conform to this criterion depends on contextual factors, and can change in the course of time. Our analysis provides a general account of how understanding is provided by scientific explanations of diverse types. In this way, it reconciles conflicting views of explanatory understanding, such as the causal-mechanical and the unificationist conceptions.},

However, the exact form as well as the normative status ofabduction are still matters of controversy.

Coinciding with this development, philosophers have increasingly promoted Bayesianism as the best normative account of how humans ought to reason. In this paper, we make a push for exploring the probabilistic terrain outside of Bayesianism. Non-Bayesian, but still probabilistic, theories provide plausible competitors both to descriptive and normative Bayesian accounts. We argue for this general idea via recent work on explanationist models of updating, which are fundamentally probabilistic but assign a substantial, non-Bayesian role to explanatory considerations.},

  abstract = {The Bayesian approach to data analysis provides a powerful way to handle uncertainty in all observations, model parameters, and model structure using probability theory. Probabilistic programming languages make it easier to specify and fit Bayesian models, but this still leaves us with many options regarding constructing, evaluating, and using these models, along with many remaining challenges in computation. Using Bayesian inference to solve real-world problems requires not only statistical skills, subject matter knowledge, and programming, but also awareness of the decisions made in the process of data analysis. All of these aspects can be understood as part of a tangled workflow of applied Bayesian statistics. Beyond inference, the workflow also includes iterative model building, model checking, validation and troubleshooting of computational problems, model understanding, and model comparison. We review all these aspects of workflow in the context of several examples, keeping in mind that in practice we will be fitting many models for any given problem, even if only a subset of them will ultimately be relevant for our conclusions.},

Computer simulations are used to show that the overlap coherence measure achieves this goal, enabling the true explanation to be identified almost as often as an approach which simply selects the most probable explanation. Further advantages to this approach are also considered in the case where there is uncertainty in the prior probability distribution.},

The theory distinguishes between definitions and constraints, with the former used to elaborate existing explanations and the latter used to detect and repair inconsistencies. We also describe PENUMBRA, an implemented system that instantiates the theory, and demonstrate its behavior on a number of domains. The system carries out heuristic search through a space of explanations, processing observations incrementally, and generating alternative accounts for a given set of inputs. We conclude by discussing related approaches to explanation, limitations of the implementation, and directions for future research.},

After a brief review of pomdp's, this paper discusses several simple solution methods and shows that all are capable of finding nearoptimal policies for a selection of extremely small pomdp's taken from the learning literature. In contrast, we show that none are able to solve a slightly larger and noisier problem based on robot navigation. We find that a combination of two novel approaches performs well on these problems and suggest methods for scaling to even larger and more complicated domains. 1 INTRODUCTION  Mobile robots must act on the basis of their cu...},
