  abstract = {In the philosophical literature, the term ``abduction'' isused in two related but different senses. In both senses, the termrefers to some form of explanatory reasoning. However, in thehistorically first sense, it refers to the place of explanatoryreasoning in generating hypotheses, while in the sense inwhich it is used most frequently in the modern literature it refers tothe place of explanatory reasoning in justifying hypotheses.In the latter sense, abduction is also often called ``Inferenceto the Best Explanation.'', This entry is exclusively concerned with abduction in the modernsense, although there is a supplement on abduction in the historicalsense, which had its origin in the work of Charles SandersPeirce\textemdash see the, See also the entry on scientific discovery, in particular the section on discovery as abduction., Most philosophers agree that abduction (in the sense of Inference tothe Best Explanation) is a type of inference that is frequentlyemployed, in some form or other, both in everyday and in scientificreasoning. However, the exact form as well as the normative status ofabduction are still matters of controversy. This entry contrastsabduction with other types of inference; points at prominent uses ofit, both in and outside philosophy; considers various more or lessprecise statements of it; discusses its normative status; andhighlights possible connections between abduction and Bayesianconfirmation theory.},

  abstract = {This article compares inference to the best explanation with Bayes's rule in a social setting, specifically, in the context of a variant of the Hegselmann\textendash Krause model in which agents not only update their belief states on the basis of evidence they receive directly from the world, but also take into account the belief states of their fellow agents. So far, the update rules mentioned have been studied only in an individualistic setting, and it is known that in such a setting both have their strengths as well as their weaknesses. It is shown here that in a social setting, inference to the best explanation outperforms Bayes's rule according to every desirable criterion.},

  abstract = {There has been a probabilistic turn in contemporary cognitive science. Far and away, most of the work in this vein is Bayesian, at least in name. Coinciding with this development, philosophers have increasingly promoted Bayesianism as the best normative account of how humans ought to reason. In this paper, we make a push for exploring the probabilistic terrain outside of Bayesianism. Non-Bayesian, but still probabilistic, theories provide plausible competitors both to descriptive and normative Bayesian accounts. We argue for this general idea via recent work on explanationist models of updating, which are fundamentally probabilistic but assign a substantial, non-Bayesian role to explanatory considerations.},

  abstract = {In the form of inference known as inference to the best explanation there are various ways to characterise what is meant by the best explanation. This paper considers a number of such characterisations including several based on confirmation measures and several based on coherence measures. The goal is to find a measure which adequately captures what is meant by `best' and which also yields the truth with a high degree of probability. Computer simulations are used to show that the overlap coherence measure achieves this goal, enabling the true explanation to be identified almost as often as an approach which simply selects the most probable explanation. Further advantages to this approach are also considered in the case where there is uncertainty in the prior probability distribution.},

While the study of pomdp's is motivated by a need to address realistic problems, existing techniques for finding optimal behavior do not appear to scale well and have been unable to find satisfactory policies for problems with more than a dozen states. After a brief review of pomdp's, this paper discusses several simple solution methods and shows that all are capable of finding nearoptimal policies for a selection of extremely small pomdp's taken from the learning literature. In contrast, we show that none are able to solve a slightly larger and noisier problem based on robot navigation. We find that a combination of two novel approaches performs well on these problems and suggest methods for scaling to even larger and more complicated domains. 1 INTRODUCTION  Mobile robots must act on the basis of their cu...},

The primary reason for this is that it is not at all clear what it means for a hypothesis to be the best available explanation of the evidence. This chapter first seeks to rectify this problem by developing a formal explication of the explanatory virtue of power. A resulting account of inference to the best explanation is then evaluated as a form of uncertain inference. Overall, the chapter offers a precise account and novel defense of one important version of inference to the best explanation.},
