  abstract = {Human experts in many scientific fields routinely work with data that are heterogeneous, noisy, and/or uncertain, as well as with heuristics that are unproven and with possible conclusions that are contradictory. We present a deployed software system for cosmogenic isotope dating, a domain that is fraught with these difficult issues. This system, which is called ACE (Age Calculation En-gine), takes as inputs the nuclide densities in a set of rock samples from a landform. It answers the scientific question, ``What geological processes could have produced this distribution of nuclide concentrations, and over what time scales? '' ACE employs an encoded knowledge base of the pos-sible processes that may have acted on that landform in the past, complete with the mathematics of how those processes can affect samples, and it uses a workflow system to encode the computations associated with this scientific analysis. Flexibility and extensibility were critical issues in ACE's design to allow its scientist-users to modify and extend it after its developers were no longer in-volved. The success of this is evident; the system remains in active use to this day, several years after the development cycle ended, without a single request for help from the geoscientists to the computer science side of the team. The ACE project website has received over 17,000 hits since 2008, including 2500 over the last twelve months. The software ({$\sim$}20,000 lines of Python code) has been downloaded nearly 600 times as of April 2013, which is a significant number in a research community of a few hundred PI-level scientists. 1.},

  abstract = {Humans are adept at inferring the mental states underlying other agents' actions, such as goals, beliefs, desires, emotions and other thoughts. We propose a computational framework based on Bayesian inverse planning for modeling human action understanding. The framework represents an intuitive theory of intentional agents' behavior based on the principle of rationality: the expectation that agents will plan approximately rationally to achieve their goals, given their beliefs about the world. The mental states that caused an agent's behavior are inferred by inverting this model of rational planning using Bayesian inference, integrating the likelihood of the observed actions with the prior over mental states. This approach formalizes in precise probabilistic terms the essence of previous qualitative approaches to action understanding based on an ``intentional stance'' [Dennett, D. C. (1987). The intentional stance. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press] or a ``teleological stance'' [Gergely, G., N\'adasdy, Z., Csibra, G., \& Bir\'o, S. (1995). Taking the intentional stance at 12 months of age. Cognition, 56, 165\textendash 193]. In three psychophysical experiments using animated stimuli of agents moving in simple mazes, we assess how well different inverse planning models based on different goal priors can predict human goal inferences. The results provide quantitative evidence for an approximately rational inference mechanism in human goal inference within our simplified stimulus paradigm, and for the flexible nature of goal representations that human observers can adopt. We discuss the implications of our experimental results for human action understanding in real-world contexts, and suggest how our framework might be extended to capture other kinds of mental state inferences, such as inferences about beliefs, or inferring whether an entity is an intentional agent.},

The development and neural substrates of mentalizing are well-studied, but its computational basis is only beginning to be probed. Here we present a model of core mentalizing computations: inferring jointly an actor's beliefs, desires and percepts from how they move in the local spatial environment. Our Bayesian theory of mind (BToM) model is based on probabilistically inverting artificial-intelligence approaches to rational planning and state estimation, which extend classical expected-utility agent models to sequential actions in complex, partially observable domains. The model accurately captures the quantitative mental-state judgements of human participants in two experiments, each varying multiple stimulus dimensions across a large number of stimuli. Comparative model fits with both simpler `lesioned' BToM models and a family of simpler non-mentalistic motion features reveal the value contributed by each component of our model.},

Our analysis provides a general account of how understanding is provided by scientific explanations of diverse types.

Probabilistic programming languages make it easier to specify and fit Bayesian models, but this still leaves us with many options regarding constructing, evaluating, and using these models, along with many remaining challenges in computation. Using Bayesian inference to solve real-world problems requires not only statistical skills, subject matter knowledge, and programming, but also awareness of the decisions made in the process of data analysis. All of these aspects can be understood as part of a tangled workflow of applied Bayesian statistics. Beyond inference, the workflow also includes iterative model building, model checking, validation and troubleshooting of computational problems, model understanding, and model comparison. We review all these aspects of workflow in the context of several examples, keeping in mind that in practice we will be fitting many models for any given problem, even if only a subset of them will ultimately be relevant for our conclusions.},

Corroboration has a wider variety of explicata, one of them being "weight of evidence." This, too, is essentially unique if probabilities of hypotheses are not to appear explicitly in the formula. In the choice of an experimental design we may have difficulty in judging the relevant utilities. In such cases it may be reasonable to base the choice on a knowledge of the probability distribution of some measure of corroboration, and especially on the expectation.},

To this end, we have developed a new point-based POMDP algorithm that exploits the notion of optimally reachable belief spaces to improve computational efficiency. In simulation, we successfully applied the algorithm to a set of common robotic tasks, including instances of coastal navigation, grasping, mobile robot exploration, and target tracking, all modeled as POMDPs with a large number of states. In most of the instances studied, our algorithm substantially outperformed one of the fastest existing point-based algorithms. A software package implementing our algorithm will soon be released at http://motion.comp.nus.edu.sg/ projects/pomdp/pomdp.html.},

  abstract = {Humans regularly explain observations of their environment in terms of background knowledge. This process is better characterized as abduction than as deduction, since it often requires introduction of assumptions about unobserved relations. In this paper, we present a theory of abductive explanation that builds on earlier work but extends it in new directions. The theory distinguishes between definitions and constraints, with the former used to elaborate existing explanations and the latter used to detect and repair inconsistencies. We also describe PENUMBRA, an implemented system that instantiates the theory, and demonstrate its behavior on a number of domains. The system carries out heuristic search through a space of explanations, processing observations incrementally, and generating alternative accounts for a given set of inputs. We conclude by discussing related approaches to explanation, limitations of the implementation, and directions for future research.},

  abstract = {Pragmatism is a philosophical tradition that \textendash{} very broadly\textendash{} understands knowing the world as inseparable from agencywithin it. This general idea has attracted a remarkably rich and attimes contrary range of interpretations, including: that allphilosophical concepts should be tested via scientificexperimentation, that a claim is true if and only if it is useful(relatedly: if a philosophical theory does not contribute directly tosocial progress then it is not worth much), that experience consistsin transacting with rather than representing nature, that articulatelanguage rests on a deep bed of shared human practices that can neverbe fully `made explicit'. , Pragmatism originated in the United States around 1870, and nowpresents a growing third alternative to both analytic and`Continental' philosophical traditions worldwide. Itsfirst generation was initiated by the so-called `classicalpragmatists' Charles Sanders Peirce (1839\textendash 1914), who firstdefined and defended the view, and his close friend and colleagueWilliam James (1842\textendash 1910), who further developed and ablypopularized it. James' Harvard colleague Josiah Royce(1855\textendash 1916), although officially allied with absolute idealism,proved a valuable interlocutor for many of these ideas. A significantinfluence in those early years was the scientific revolution thentaking place around evolutionary theory, of which first generationpragmatists were keen observers and sometime participants (Pearce2020). These pragmatists focused significantly on theorising inquiry,meaning and the nature of truth, although James put these themes towork exploring truth in religion. A second (still termed`classical') generation turned pragmatist philosophy moreexplicitly towards politics, education and other dimensions of socialimprovement, under the immense influence of John Dewey(1859\textendash 1952) and his friend Jane Addams (1860\textendash 1935) \textendash who invented the profession of social work as an expression ofpragmatist ideas (and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1931). Alsoof considerable importance at this time was George Herbert Mead(1863\textendash 1931), who contributed significantly to the socialsciences, developing pragmatist perspectives upon the relationsbetween the self and the community (Mead 1934), whilst philosophy ofrace was germinated by pioneering African-American philosophers W.E.BDu Bois (1868\textendash 1963) and Alain Locke (1885\textendash 1954), who alsoengaged in productive dialogue with one another. As the progressiveDeweyan `New Deal' era passed away and the US moved intothe Cold War, pragmatism's influence was challenged, as analyticphilosophy blossomed and became the dominant methodologicalorientation in most Anglo-American philosophy departments.Transitional or `third generation' figures included C.I.Lewis (1883\textendash 1964) and W.V.O. Quine (1908\textendash 2000); althoughthese philosophers developed a number of pragmatist themes, theiranalytic allegiance may be seen in their significant focus on theoryof knowledge as first philosophy (which Dewey deprecated as `theepistemological industry')., Following this dip in popularity, since the 1970s the pragmatisttradition has undergone a significant revival. Richard Rorty(1931\textendash 2007) turned consciously to pragmatism to rectify what hesaw as mainstream epistemology's crucial mistake: naivelyconceiving of language and thought as `mirroring' theworld. Rorty's bold and iconoclastic attacks on this`representationalism' birthed a so-calledneopragmatism to which a number of influential recentphilosophers have contributed (e.g. Hilary Putnam, Robert Brandom andHuw Price). Other pragmatists have objected to Rorty's blithedismissal of truth as a topic better left undiscussed (Rorty 1982),and have sought to rehabilitate classical pragmatist ideals ofobjectivity (e.g. Susan Haack, Christopher Hookway and Cheryl Misak).These philosophers are now sometimes referred to as NewPragmatists. Yet others have worked to place pragmatist ideas in abroader Western philosophical context, for instance tracingPeirce's significant debt to Kant (Apel 1974, Gava 2014), andconnections between pragmatism and 19th century idealism (Margolis2010, Stern 2009). Meanwhile, classical pragmatism's progressivesocial ideals lived on in some quarters, with notable contributions tophilosophy of race made by Cornel West, who advanced a propheticpragmatism drawing on both Christian and Marxian thought, andshowcasing the earlier contributions of Du Bois and Locke (e.g. West1989). A number of other liberatory philosophical projects in areassuch as feminism (Seigfried 1996), ecology (Alexander 2013), NativeAmerican philosophy (Pratt 2002) and Latin American philosophy (Pappas1998) also currently look to the pragmatist tradition as theirphilosophical home. , Meanwhile, increasingly pragmatism's intellectual centre ofgravity is moving out of North America, with vibrant research networksappearing in South America, Scandinavia and more recently centralEurope and China. , The core of pragmatism as Peirce originally conceived it was thePragmatic Maxim, a rule for clarifying the meaning of hypotheses bytracing their `practical consequences' \textendash{} theirimplications for experience in specific situations. For Peirce andJames, a key application of the Maxim was clarifying the concept oftruth. This produced a distinctive epistemological outlook: afallibilist, anti-Cartesian explication of the norms that governinquiry. Within that broad outlook, though, early pragmatists splitsignificantly over questions of realism broadly conceived\textendash{} essentially, whether pragmatism should conceive itself as ascientific philosophy holding monism about truth (following Peirce),or a more broad-based alethic pluralism (following James and Dewey).This dispute was poignantly emblematized in arguments between Peirceand James which led Peirce to rename his view pragmaticism,presenting this clarified viewpoint to the world as his new`baby' which was, he hoped, `ugly enough to be safefrom kidnappers' (EP2: 355)., The first part of this entry is devoted to the classicalpragmatists' distinctive methods, and how they give rise to anoriginal a posteriori epistemology. After that we will brieflyexplore some of the many other areas of philosophy in which richpragmatist contributions have been made.}

While the study of pomdp's is motivated by a need to address realistic problems, existing techniques for finding optimal behavior do not appear to scale well and have been unable to find satisfactory policies for problems with more than a dozen states. After a brief review of pomdp's, this paper discusses several simple solution methods and shows that all are capable of finding nearoptimal policies for a selection of extremely small pomdp's taken from the learning literature. In contrast, we show that none are able to solve a slightly larger and noisier problem based on robot navigation. We find that a combination of two novel approaches performs well on these problems and suggest methods for scaling to even larger and more complicated domains. 1 INTRODUCTION  Mobile robots must act on the basis of their cu...},

Recent evidence suggests that in the course of an individual's reasoning, engaging in explanation can have profound effects on the probability assigned to causal claims, on how properties are generalized and on learning. These effects follow from two properties of the structure of explanations: explanations accommodate novel information in the context of prior beliefs, and do so in a way that fosters generalization. The study of explanation thus promises to shed light on core cognitive issues, such as learning, induction and conceptual representation. Moreover, the influence of explanation on learning and inference presents a challenge to theories that neglect the roles of prior knowledge and explanation-based reasoning.},

Thosetwo features are: (1) the introduction of a formal apparatusfor inductive logic; (2) the introduction of a pragmaticself-defeat test (as illustrated by Dutch Book Arguments) forepistemic rationality as a way of extending the justificationof the laws of deductive logic to include a justification for the lawsof inductive logic. The formal apparatus itself has two main elements:the use of the laws of probability as coherence constraints onrational degrees of belief (or degrees of confidence) and theintroduction of a rule of probabilistic inference, a rule or principleof conditionalization., Bayesian epistemology did not emerge as a philosophical programuntil the first formal axiomatizations of probability theory in thefirst half of the 20th century. One importantapplication of Bayesian epistemology has been to the analysis ofscientific practice in Bayesian Confirmation Theory. Inaddition, a major branch of statistics, Bayesianstatistics, is based on Bayesian principles. In psychology,an important branch of learning theory, Bayesian learningtheory, is also based on Bayesian principles. Finally, theidea of analyzing rational degrees of belief in terms of rationalbetting behavior led to the 20th century development of anew kind of decision theory, Bayesian decision theory, which isnow the dominant theoretical model for both the descriptive andnormative analysis of decisions. The combination of its preciseformal apparatus and its novel pragmatic self-defeat test forjustification makes Bayesian epistemology one of the most importantdevelopments in epistemology in the 20th century, and one ofthe most promising avenues for further progress in epistemology in the21st century.},

  abstract = {When a major engineering product failed, a failure investigation is often conducted to prevent similar failures in the future. In this dissertation, I propose an account of the epistemology and methodology of engineering failure investigations, based on a close examination of five major plane crash investigations conducted by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). The dissertation is divided into three parts. The first part consists of the five case studies. In each case study, I summarize the entire investigation process, focusing on articulating the questions that arise and the evidential reasoning that helped resolve each question. The second part examines how the investigators infer causes of failure events. The type of causal inference used in failure investigations typically proceeds from effects to causes, hence it is called reverse causal inference. I identify three types of reverse causal inference in engineering failure investigations: feature dependence, additional outcomes, and process tracing. The third part examines how the investigators construct narratives of failure events and support them with evidence. I argue that both the construction and the justification of a narrative of a failure event depend on the question-and-answer process in the investigation, which I call the question dynamics of the investigation. I examine three main components of the question dynamics: the resolution of questions, the significance of questions, and the arising of questions. I conclude the dissertation with an account of the coherence of narratives, which captures the intuitive idea that the pieces of a coherent narrative "fit together" very well},
